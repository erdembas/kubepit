# Kubepit architecture

Kubepit is a local-first Kubernetes IDE for many clusters (think Freelens/Lens),
built with the RunHQ stack and design system: **Tauri 2 + Rust** on the backend,
**React 18 + Tailwind v4 + Zustand** on the frontend.

```

## Contract

`apps/desktop/src/types/index.ts` and `apps/desktop/src/lib/ipc.ts` are the
single source of truth for the frontend ⇄ backend boundary.

- Command names are the snake_case strings passed to `call(...)`.
- JS argument names are camelCase; Tauri maps them to the snake_case Rust
  parameters (`clusterId` → `cluster_id`). Struct fields cross verbatim, so
  serde structs use the same snake_case names as the TS interfaces.
  (`KubeObject` is raw Kubernetes JSON and keeps its camelCase fields.)
- Errors are returned as `Err(String)` with a human-readable message.
- Streams use typed `tauri::ipc::Channel<T>` parameters (`onEvent`, `onChunk`,
  `onOutput`).
- Global events: `cluster://status` (ClusterStatus), `cluster://list`
  (ClusterDef[]), `portforward://changed` (PortForward[]), `terminal://exit`
  (`{ id, code }`), `workspace://changed` (`{ source, snapshot }`, the
  window label that saved `workspace.json`).

## Windows

`window_open` adds app windows (`win-*`) beside `main`; all of them share
one backend (connections, port forwards, the PTY manager) and one origin.
A new window starts as a copy of its opener (`lib/windowSeed.ts`); only
`main` persists the workbench session, while layout prefs are shared and
synced live (`store/windowStorage.ts`). Streams are per window (their
channels belong to the webview); terminals are destroyed with the window
that created them (`src-tauri/src/windows.rs`).

## Persistence (`~/.kubepit`, override with `KUBEPIT_HOME`)

| File                    | Owner    | Content                                             |
| ----------------------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `clusters.json`         | backend  | `ClusterDef[]`                                      |
| `settings.json`         | backend  | `Settings`                                          |
| `workspace.json`        | frontend | `WorkspaceSnapshot` (sections, ordering) — opaque   |
| `kubeconfigs/<id>.yaml` | backend  | pasted kubeconfigs (`managed: true`), mode 0600     |
| `run/<id>.kubeconfig`   | backend  | single-context kubeconfig for kubectl/helm/terminal |

Kubepit never rewrites a user's kubeconfig files.

## Kubernetes access

- `kube` 4.x with `ws` (exec/port-forward), `runtime` (watcher), rustls.
- One `kube::Client` per connected cluster, built from the cluster's
  kubeconfig + context. Exec auth plugins (aws, gke-gcloud-auth-plugin,
  kubelogin) work because startup imports the login-shell `PATH`.
- Resources are handled generically through `DynamicObject` + `ApiResource`
  built from a `Gvk`; typed k8s-openapi structs are used only where logic
  needs them (pods for logs/exec, nodes for drain, metrics).
- `managedFields` are stripped from everything sent to the UI.
- Watches are batched (~150 ms) into `WatchBatch` messages.
- `read_only` clusters reject every mutating command in the backend (dry runs
  and RBAC self-reviews only read, so they stay available).

## Terminals

The RunHQ PTY pipeline (portable-pty + bounded, acknowledged base64 output
channel) is reused verbatim. `TerminalSpec` selects what runs in the PTY:

- `local` — login shell; with a cluster, `KUBECONFIG` points at
  `run/<id>.kubeconfig`.
- `pod-exec` / `pod-attach` — `kubectl exec -it` / `kubectl attach -it`.
- `node-shell` — privileged helper pod (`hostPID`, `nsenter -t 1 -m -u -i -n`)
  plus `kubectl exec`; the pod is deleted when the terminal closes.

## Helm

Releases are read natively from `sh.helm.release.v1.*` secrets
(base64 → gzip → JSON). Rollback, uninstall and upgrade shell out to `helm`.

Charts (`helm_charts.rs`) use the user's own helm configuration: repositories
(`helm repo list|add|remove|update`), the catalog (`helm search repo`),
chart details (`helm show chart|readme|values`, cached for five minutes) and
Artifact Hub (`helm search hub`, only on demand). Installs and upgrades run
with `--output json` and reuse the release decoding above; dry runs
(`--dry-run=server`, `--dry-run` before helm 3.13) are allowed on read-only
clusters. Values go through a private temp file and repository passwords
through `--password-stdin`.

## GitOps (Argo CD, Flux)

GitOps support is UI-side on top of the generic resource commands; there is
no backend code and no dependency on the `argocd` or `flux` CLIs.

- Detection is discovery-driven (`lib/kube/gitops/kinds.ts`): Argo CD
  Applications, ApplicationSets and AppProjects plus every kind of the Flux
  toolkit groups (`kustomize`, `helm`, `source`, `notification`, `image`).
  The navigator's GitOps section (moved out of Custom Resources) and the
  `@gitops` overview only appear when one of them is served.
- The overview (`components/workbench/gitops/GitOpsPage.tsx`) watches
  Applications, Kustomizations and HelmReleases cluster-wide (falling back to
  the selected namespaces when that is forbidden) and normalizes them into
  one row model (`lib/kube/gitops/model.ts`: sync, health, short revision,
  source, destination, last sync, suspended, message, status bucket). A row
  matches the namespace filter through its own or its destination namespace.
- Details sections (`details/sections/ArgoSections.tsx`, `FluxSections.tsx`)
  are chosen by API group, not kind name; managed resources (Argo
  `status.resources`) and Flux inventories (`status.inventory`) render as a
  namespace → kind tree whose names open the objects.
- Actions (`actions/gitopsActions.tsx`) are merge patches through
  `resource_patch`, so `read_only` and RBAC (`ACTION_ACCESS`) apply as for
  any mutation (`lib/kube/gitops/patches.ts`): Argo refresh / hard refresh
  (`argocd.argoproj.io/refresh`), sync (the `operation` the Argo CD API sets:
  revision, prune, dry run, force, sync options, retry), terminate
  (`status.operationState.phase: Terminating`) and auto-sync / prune /
  self-heal; Flux reconcile (`reconcile.fluxcd.io/requestedAt`, plus
  `forceAt` / `resetAt` for HelmReleases, optionally the source first) and
  suspend / resume (`spec.suspend`).
- "Managed by GitOps" (`lib/kube/gitops/managed.ts`, `gitops/owner.ts`):
  Argo tracking ids (`argocd.argoproj.io/tracking-id`, checked against the
  object's identity), Argo instance labels (only when a matching Application
  exists) and Flux `kustomize|helm.toolkit.fluxcd.io/name|namespace` labels
  resolve to the owner. The details header shows a badge linking to it, and
  edit, scale, set image, restart and delete show what a manual change will
  run into (self-heal, reconcile interval, drift detection, suspended)
  without blocking.
- The demo backend (`mock/fixtures/gitops.ts`) adds Applications in every
  state, an app of apps, an ApplicationSet and Flux on staging and dev;
  `mock/gitops.ts` plays the controllers so patched objects move like real
  ones.

## Workload operations

- `rollout.rs` builds rollout history from owned ReplicaSets (Deployments)
  or ControllerRevisions (StatefulSets, DaemonSets) and undoes to a revision
  with `kubectl rollout undo` semantics.
- `images.rs` sets container images with a strategic merge patch at the
  pod-template path of each kind and records `kubernetes.io/change-cause`.
- `dry_run.rs` sends every document of a manifest with `dryRun=All` and
  returns live vs. result per document; the editors show it as a review
  before applying (always on production clusters). Dry runs never mutate,
  so they are allowed on read-only clusters.

## Logs & debug

- `workload_logs.rs` watches the pods of a label selector and fans out one
  follow stream per container (at most 64), batching complete lines of all
  sources every 100 ms into `WorkloadLogBatch` messages.
- `debug_container.rs` adds an ephemeral container through the pod's
  `ephemeralcontainers` subresource and waits until it runs; the UI then
  attaches a terminal to it.
- `pod_fs.rs` lists, previews, downloads and uploads container files with
  POSIX `sh` scripts over exec (GNU coreutils and busybox); folders download
  as `.tar`.

## Fleet

- `metrics_history.rs` samples metrics-server every 15 s while a cluster is
  connected and keeps 60 minutes of f32 ring buffers for the cluster, each
  node and up to 5 000 pods; it stops with the connection.
- `fleet_search.rs` searches every connected cluster concurrently with
  metadata-only lists (substring, glob or `/regex/` names, server-side label
  selectors) and streams results per cluster.
- Cross-cluster compare and drift are UI-side: `resource_get` on each
  cluster, `lib/kube/normalize.ts` (mode `compare`) and `lib/diff.ts`.

## Access (RBAC)

`access.rs` wraps SelfSubjectAccessReview, SelfSubjectRulesReview and
SelfSubjectReview. The UI evaluates the namespace's rules locally
(`lib/kube/access.ts`, cached in `useAccessStore`) and falls back to
batched access reviews; actions declare what they need in
`components/workbench/actions/access.ts`. Unknown answers never block the
UI — the API server still enforces.

## Diffs

Every diff (apply review, rollout revisions, Helm revisions, compare and
drift) renders through `components/workbench/common/DiffView.tsx` on top of
Monaco's diff editor, with `lib/diff.ts` (Myers line diff) for stats and the
fallback view.
